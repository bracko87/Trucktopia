# netlify.toml
# This file instructs Netlify how to build and publish the site.
# Update `publish` if your project's build output directory differs (commonly 'dist' or 'build').

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[context.production.environment]
  # Add any build-time env vars here if you want defaults.
  # Note: For secrets (service_role keys), keep them in Netlify UI secrets or server-side only.
  # Example (do NOT add real secrets here):
  # REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL = "https://xyz.supabase.co"
  # REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "public-anon-key"
